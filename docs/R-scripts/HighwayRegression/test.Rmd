## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
tdir <- tempdir()
doctype <- "rmd2html-guide"
dirout <- initWriteup(doctype, dir = file.path(tdir, doctype))
list.files(dirout)
result <- try(rmd2html("skeleton.Rmd", wd = dirout))
if(inherits(result, "try-error")){
MESSG <- paste("Compiling the markdown file failed, perhaps",
"your version of pandoc is not found")
print(MESSG)
} else {
## Check the result file:
MESSG <- paste("Check the directory", dirout, "for results.")
print(MESSG)
list.files(dirout)
if(interactive() && file.exists(file.path(dirout, "skeleton.html"))) {
browseURL(file.path(dirout, "skeleton.html"))
}
}
unlink(dirout)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
