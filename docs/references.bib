abstract = {Urbanization poses a global challenge to species conservation. This is primarily understood in terms of physical habitat loss, as agricultural and forested lands are replaced with urban infrastructure. However, aquatic habitats are also chemically degraded by urban development, often in the form of toxic stormwater runoff. Here we assess threats of urbanization to coho salmon throughout developed areas of the Puget Sound Basin in Washington, USA. Puget Sound coho are a sentinel species for freshwater communities and also a species of concern under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Previous studies have demonstrated that stormwater runoff is unusually lethal to adult coho that return to spawn each year in urban watersheds. To further explore the relationship between land use and recurrent coho die-offs, we measured mortality rates in field surveys of 51 spawning sites across an urban gradient. We then used spatial analyses to measure landscape attributes (land use and land cover, human population density, roadways, traffic intensity, etc.) and climatic variables (annual summer and fall precipitation) associated with each site. Structural equation modeling revealed a latent urbanization gradient that was associated with road density and traffic intensity, among other variables, and positively related to coho mortality. Across years within sites, mortality increased with summer and fall precipitation, but the effect of rainfall was strongest in the least developed areas and was essentially neutral in the most urbanized streams. We used the best-supported structural equation model to generate a predictive mortality risk map for the entire Puget Sound Basin. This map indicates an ongoing and widespread loss of spawners across much of the Puget Sound population segment, particularly within the major regional north-south corridor for transportation and development. Our findings identify current and future urbanization-related threats to wild coho, and show where green infrastructure and similar clean water strategies could prove most useful for promoting species conservation and recovery.},

abstract = {A microarray targeting four sequenced strains in the Dehalococcoides (Dhc) genus was used to analyze gene expression in a robust long-term trichloroethene (TCE)-degrading microbial community (designated ANAS) during feeding cycles that involve conditions of periodic substrate supply. The Dhc transcriptome was examined at three time-points throughout a batch feeding cycle: T1 (27 h) when TCE, dichloroethene (DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC) were present; T2 (54 h) when only VC remained; and T3 (13 days) when Dhc had been starved of substrate for 9 days. Ninety percent of the Dhc open reading frames (ORFs) that were detected in the ANAS DNA were found to be expressed as RNA sometime during the time course, demonstrating extraordinary utilization of the streamlined genome. Ninety-seven percent of these transcripts were differentially expressed during the time course indicating efficiency of transcription through regulation in Dhc. Most Dhc genes were significantly down-regulated at T3 , responding to a lack of substrate as would be expected. The tceA and vcrA genes, which code for proteins with known chlorinated ethene reduction functions, were highly expressed at both T1 and T2 , whereas two other putative reductive dehalogenase genes (DET0173 and DET1545) were most highly expressed at T2 , likely in response to the presence of VC. Hydrogenases were most highly expressed at T1 , reflecting their important role in accumulating electrons used to initiate reductive dechlorination and other biosynthesis pathways. Cobalamin transport genes were preferentially expressed at T2 , reflecting an increase in corrinoid transport as chloroethenes were degraded and a decrease in activity of the transport system after dehalogenation was complete. This is the first application of a microarray targeting a known genus, including both core genomes and identified strain-specific genes, to improve our understanding of transcriptional dynamics within an undefined microbial community.},

abstract = {Nonpoint source pollution in the form of stormwater runoff is one of the most important emerging threats to ecosystems along the coastal margins of the United States. A wide diversity of potentially toxic chemicals is commonly found in stormwater. These include the various pesticides, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and other common contaminants that originate from commercial, industrial, residential, and agricultural land-use activities. These chemicals are mobilized from roads, lawns, crops, and other surfaces by rainfall and then transported to aquatic habitats via terrestrial runoff. The ongoing development of coastal watersheds nationwide is increasing the loading of nonpoint source pollutants to rivers, estuaries, and the near- shore marine environment. A central aim of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's national Coastal Storms Program (CSP) is to enhance the resiliency of coastal ecosystems by improving the ability of coastal communities to anticipate and reduce the impacts of contaminated terrestrial runoff. Toxic chemicals in stormwater can adversely impact the health of fish, including threatened and endangered species. Nonpoint source pollution can also degrade the biological integrity of aquatic com- munities that support productive fish populations. This article examines the effects of stormwater runoff on fish and fisheries. Using case studies drawn from CSP project work in the Pacific Northwest and Southern California pilot regions, we show how de- graded water quality can impact the health of fish during critical life history stages (i.e., spawning and rearing) as well as limit the overall effectiveness of fish habitat restoration. We also discuss some of the resources currently available to local communities to reduce the loading of toxics in stormwater, thereby increasing the resilience of aquatic communities. Finally, we identify priority areas for new research to help guide the future conservation and recovery of at-risk fish populations.},

abstract = {Since the late 1990s, monitoring efforts evaluating the effectiveness of urban stream restoration projects in the greater metropolitan area of Seattle, Washington, USA, have detected high rates of premature mortality among adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in restored spawning habitats. Affected animals display a consistent suite of symptoms (e.g., disorientation, lethargy, loss of equilibrium, gaping, fin splaying) that ultimately progresses to death on a timescale of a few hours. Annual rates of prespawn mortality observed over multiple years, across several drainages, have ranged from approximately 20{\%} to 90{\%} of the total fall run within a given watershed. Current weight-of-evidence suggests that coho prespawn mortality is caused by toxic urban stormwater runoff. To evaluate the potential consequences of current and future urbanization on wild coho salmon, we constructed life-history models to estimate the impacts of prespawn mortality on coho populations and metapopulations. At the low (20{\%}) and high (90{\%}) ends of the range of observed mortality, model results indicated the mean time to extinction of localized coho populations in 115 and 8 y, respectively. The presence of productive source populations (i.e., unaffected by prespawn mortality) within a metapopulation reduced local extinction risk. However, as more populations within a metapopulation become affected by spawner die-offs prior to spawning, the source population's productivity declined. These simple models demonstrate the potential for rapid losses from coho populations in urbanizing watersheds. Because the models do not account for possible impacts of toxic runoff to other coho life stages, they likely underestimate the cumulative impacts of nonpoint source pollution on wild populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 SETAC.},

abstract = {The term "urban stream syndrome" describes the consistently observed ecological degradation of streams draining urban land. This paper reviews recent literature to describe symptoms of the syndrome, explores mechanisms driving the syndrome, and identifies appropriate goals and methods for ecological restoration of urban streams. Symptoms of the urban stream syndrome include a flashier hydrograph, elevated concentrations of nutrients and contaminants, altered channel morphology, and reduced biotic richness, with increased dominance of tolerant species. More research is needed before generalizations can be made about urban effects on stream ecosystem processes, but reduced nutrient uptake has been consistently reported. The mechanisms driving the syndrome are complex and interactive, but most impacts can be ascribed to a few major large-scale sources, primarily urban stormwater runoff delivered to streams by hydraulically efficient drainage systems. Other stressors, such as combined or sanitary sewer overflows, wastewater treatment plant effluents, and legacy pollutants (long-lived pollutants from earlier land uses) can obscure the effects of stormwater runoff. Most research on urban impacts to streams has concentrated on correlations between instream ecological metrics and total catchment imperviousness. Recent research shows that some of the variance in such relationships can be explained by the distance between the stream reach and urban land, or by the hydraulic efficiency of stormwater drainage. The mechanisms behind such patterns require experimentation at the catchment scale to identify the best management approaches to conservation and restoration of streams in urban catchments. Remediation of stormwater impacts is most likely to be achieved through widespread application of innovative approaches to drainage design. Because humans dominate urban ecosystems, research on urban stream ecology will require a broadening of stream ecological research to integrate with social, behavioral, and economic research. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The North American Benthological Society.},
