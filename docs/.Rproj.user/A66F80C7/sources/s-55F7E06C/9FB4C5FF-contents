**Instructions for Accessing Tabulated Hydrology Results via BigQuery**    

## Tabulated Results via BigQuery  {-} 

Tabulated hydrology results are available via [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), a cloud-based relational database that includes a distributed SQL engine. The data are located on the [`tnc-data-v1` data bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=tnc-data-v1) (sign-in require). The table is named `tnc-data-v1:hydrology.gfdl.` BigQuery supports several client libraries. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries for a list of supported clients libraries. 

Using R, the tnc-data-v1 databucket can be accessed through a database connection using the DBI package: 





### Schema  {-} 

The table schema are shown in Table \@ref(tab:schemaTable).

```{r schemaTable}
bq_schema_table <- read_csv("data/bq_schema.csv", 
    col_types = cols(X4 = col_skip(), X5 = col_skip()))
knitr::kable(bq_schema_table,caption = "BigQuery Table Schema for `tnc-data-v1:hydrology.gfdl.`")


```

	

### Querying Tabulated Results  {-} 

The data may be queried through Google Cloud Platform directly, or through a number of available software libraries. Queries are performed through standard SQL language. Some example queries are provided below. 

Get all surface flow components from the SeaTac precipitation grid (ID16_V7) for the years 1970-1999:   


```
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `tnc-data-v1.hydrology.gfdl`
WHERE
  grid = "ID16_V7"
  AND comp IN ('suro',
    'ifwo')
  AND year BETWEEN 1970
  AND 1999
```

Get the annual peak flow for surface flow components from the SeaTac precipitation grid (ID16_V7) for the years 1970-1999:   

```
SELECT
  max(hru250) as peakQ, Year, 
FROM
  `tnc-data-v1.hydrology.gfdl`
WHERE
  grid = "ID16_V7"
  AND comp IN ('suro',
    'ifwo')
  AND year BETWEEN 1970
  AND 1999
 Group by Year
```

### Querying Geometry  {-} 

Google BigQuery supports PostGIS geometry functions (see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions for instructions). 

Grid geometries are available from the `tnc-data-v1.gfdl.geometry` table on Big Query. The table schema is as follows: 

| Fieldname  |  Type  | Description 
|---|---|---|---|---|
grid| STRING	| WRF Grid ID Number  |
xy| GEOGRAPHY| Centroid of the grid (PostGIS point) )  |	
geohash| String|  PostGIS geohash string approximating grid boundary|	
geometry | STRING	| Well known text format of the grid boundary |

An example query to return the Grid ID covering the Seattle Center: 
```
WITH
  SeattleCenter AS (
  SELECT
    ST_geogpoint(-122.35,
      47.62) AS location)
SELECT
  grid
FROM
  `tnc-data-v1.gfdl.geometry`
WHERE
  ST_DWITHIN(ST_GEOGFROMTEXT(geometry),
    (
    SELECT
      location
    FROM
      SeattleCenter),
    0)
```
Returns the grid ID pertaining to this location: 


Row|grid
1|ID16_V9
